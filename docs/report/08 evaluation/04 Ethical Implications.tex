\section{Ethical Implications}

The \enquote{accountability} mechanism was designed as a
powerful deterrent against \gls{conspiring-users}
attempting to falsify time clocks for additional pay.

In the real world, some companies would treat
\projectname{}'s records as an absolute truth, creating a
work environment in which employees are directly
accountable for each other's attendance.

With that in mind, along with the principle that no
software system is 100\% secure, an application like 
\projectname{} could have serious, immediate, and direct
affects on people job's if misused by an employer.
