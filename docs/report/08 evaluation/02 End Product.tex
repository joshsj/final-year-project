\section{End Product}

Reflecting on the \enquote{universal}
\hyperref[ss:goal]{goal} for the project, I would consider
the end product to be in compliance: the interface is
simple, accessible, and process-oriented which suits the
system's functions; all technologies used are open-source
and free for personal and commercial use; minimal
infrastructure is required to host the application; and its
users need only a device equipped with a camera and
location services.

This project aimed to reduce/eliminate the need for a
business role who monitors employee attendance; by holding
employees accountable for each other, that responsibility
now lies on each other.
