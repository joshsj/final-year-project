\chapter*{Abstract}

The employer-employee relationship is changing. More and
more people are employed short-term, part-time, and on
zero-hours contracts, while people are starting to reject 
traditional ideologies like employer loyalty and in-office
working.

As this trend continues, the need for employers to monitor
their staff becomes increasingly important. This project
aims to offload this responsibility from managers to 
software.
