\section{Project Motivation}

At present, the employee-worker relationship is changing at
an apparent rate.
As more workers are employed under zero-hour contracts
\parencite{zeroHourContractsStats}, employee loyalty is
dwindling \parencite{zeroHourContractsLoyalty}; off the
back of the COVID-19 pandemic, employee turnover rates have
increased \parencite{employeeTurnover}; and and the
anti-work movement is motivating an outright rejection of
employment\nocite{antiWorkMovement}.

As such, employers need to be sure their employees are
working as required; i.e., when they start and stop work,
where they work, how much work they complete.
Some roles can be easily assessed, such as a software
developer; in an ideal work environment, their workload is
decomposed into individual tasks with time/effort
estimates, and their progress can be directly assessed by
viewing any changed programming code.
Additionally, their focus and dedication to the job is
directly observable if they elect to work in the office.

Conversely, some roles are much harder for an employer to
monitor, such as events management.
Work can be extremely short-term, covering many different
roles, and employees can be sourced from many facets: a
permanent contract with the venue through to casual
recommendation when desperate.
Additionally, times and locations add further
complications; a festival can have tens of tents, stages,
and bars, each of which may change every day.

This project aims to mitigate the complexity of managing
workers in these environments by providing a platform for
employees to verify employee identities and locations.
