\section{Business Configuration}

Some business rules surrounding clocking in \& out are not
black and white. The \enquote{providing location}
\hyperref[ss:stories]{user story} specifies employees should
not be able to clock in too early, or clock out too late;
confirmation codes also have a specified lifetime, as
defined in \enquote{Confirming Location \& Identity}. 

The options pattern in .NET allows the values for these rule
sets to be configured at runtime, both on the initial
startup and throughout the uptime of the application. Loaded
from configuration files, the \lstinline{BusinessOptions}
class stores these values to inject where required; see
the \hyperref[requestProcess]{request process} for usage of
the \lstinline{ConfirmationTokenWindow} value.
