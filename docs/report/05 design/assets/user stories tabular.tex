\story{Providing Location}{Confirmation}

  As an employee, I want to provide my location to submit
  a clock
}

  In all cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Location must be within the radius of the job
    \item Can only clock in/out of their own job
  \end{itemize}

  When clocking in:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Job cannot have ended
    \item Cannot currently be clocked in
    \item Cannot have clocked out
    \item Cannot clock in too early for a job
  \end{itemize}

  When clocking out:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cannot already be clocked out
    \item Must be currently clocked in
    \item Cannot clock out too late
  \end{itemize}

\story{Confirming Location \& Identity}{Confirmation}
{
  As an employee, I want to confirm my clock, so that I can
  prove the clock was not performed by another employee
}

  See the base criteria in \enquote{Providing Location}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The first employee does not need to confirm the
          clock in (principle verifier)
    \item All subsequent employees are required to confirm
          their clocks
    \item All subsequent employees can only confirm via a
          confirmed employee
    \item When clocking, information about the confirmed
          employees should be available
    \item Jobs with one assigned employee require no
          confirmation
  \end{itemize}
} \hrule

\story{Viewing Verification Chain}{Confirmation}
{
  As a user, I want to view the verification chain, so that
  I can review the clock ins/outs visually
}
{
  Each job has a diagram displaying its clock ins and outs
