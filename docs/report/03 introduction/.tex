\section{Project Motivation}

At present, the employee-worker relationship is changing at
an apparent rate.
As more workers are employed under zero-hour contracts
\parencite{zeroHourContractsStats}, employee loyalty is
dwindling \parencite{zeroHourContractsLoyalty}; off the
back of the COVID-19 pandemic, employee turnover rates have
increased \parencite{employeeTurnover}; and and the
anti-work movement is motivating an outright rejection of
employment \parencite{antiWorkMovement}.

As such, employers need to be sure their employees are
working as required; i.e., when they start and stop work,
where they work, how much work they complete.
Some roles can be easily assessed, such as a software
developer; in an ideal work environment, their workload is
decomposed into individual tasks with time/effort
estimates, and their progress can be directly assessed by
viewing any changed programming code.
Additionally, their focus and dedication to the job is
directly observable if they elect to work in the office.

Conversely, some roles are much harder for an employer to
monitor, such as events management.
Work can be extremely short-term, covering many different
roles, and employees can be sourced from many facets: a
permanent contract with the venue through to casual
recommendation when desperate.
Additionally, times and locations add further
complications; a festival can have tens of tents, stages,
and bars, each of which may change every day.

This project aims to create a software application to
mitigate some complexities of managing employees in these
environments, named 'RendezVous'.

\section{Project Aims}

The goal of the project is to implement a process for
employees to \gls{check-in} and \gls{check-out} of a job,
which concerns critical functionality of the application:
the methodology to verify an employee's identity and
location.
The following aims must be addressed to achieve this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research existing applications concerned with
        \glsdisp{check-in}{checking-in} employees
  \item Investigate methodologies to identify people,
        locations, and assets; along with their associated
        technologies
  \item Devise and design a theoretical user and location verification methodology
  \item Design the system architecture, user interfaces, and technical implementation of the 
        verification methodology
  \item Produce a set of functional and technical
  requirements for the system
    \item Produce technical and practical test plans
  \item Setup the required tools for the development and
  testing phases, plus the project management tools for both
  \item Develop and test the application
  \item Evaluate the successes of the methodology in the completed application
  \item Discuss potential improvements to increase its viability
\end{itemize}
