\section{Integration Tests}

Integration tests come next to ensure each unit functions
correctly when interacting with other units in the
application.

In contrast to unit tests, integration tests in
\projectname{} ensure the business features are implemented
as designed; this is focussed mainly on the various
constraints and preconditions when
\glsdisp{clock-in}{clocking in}/ \glsdisp{clock-out}{out}
and confirming another employee.

Figure \ref{fig:integrationTestRunner} shows the difference
in testing simple simple and complex functionality.
Querying for jobs requires only one file, whereas the rules
for clocking require many more tests spread across multiple
files.
