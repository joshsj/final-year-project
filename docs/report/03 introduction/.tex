\section{Project Motivation} \label{s:motivation}

At present, the employee-worker relationship is changing at
an apparent rate.
As more workers are employed under zero-hour contracts
\parencite{zeroHourContractsStats}, employee loyalty is
dwindling \parencite{zeroHourContractsLoyalty}; off the
back of the COVID-19 pandemic, employee turnover rates have
increased \parencite{employeeTurnover}; and and the
anti-work movement is motivating an outright rejection of
employment \parencite{antiWorkMovement}.

As such, employers need to be sure their employees are
working as required; i.e., when they start and stop work,
where they work, how much work they complete.
Some roles can be easily assessed, such as a software
developer; in an ideal work environment, their workload is
decomposed into individual tasks with time/effort
estimates, and their progress can be directly assessed by
viewing any changed programming code.
Additionally, their focus and dedication to the job is
directly observable if they elect to work in the office.

Conversely, some roles are much harder for an employer to
monitor, such as events management.
Work can be extremely short-term, covering many different
roles, and employees can be sourced from many facets: a
permanent contract with the venue through to casual
recommendation when desperate.
Additionally, times and locations add further
complications; a festival can have tens of tents, stages,
and bars, each of which may change every day.

This project looks at reducing/eliminating the
responsibility placed on managing \& supervising employees
to monitor attendance in these environments with a software
application named \enquote{\projectname}.

The use-case of the system also presents an intrinsic
problem, in that \hyperref[s:userAuth]{conventional
  authentication techniques} do not account for
\enquote{\gls{conspiring-users}}.
Normally, user authentication is implemented to secure an
individual's private information and restrict access to it
exclusively to the user.
Conversely, a system which handles
\glsdisp{clock-in}{clocking in} and
\glsdisp{clock-out}{clocking out} of jobs may instead
motivate employees to widen access to their account,
allowing other employees to clock in/out on their behalf
and collect additional, false pay.

As such, the application must minimise/eliminate the
ability to imitate other users.

\section{Project Objectives}

\subsection{Goal} \label{ss:goal}
The goal of this project is to implement a process for
employees to clock-in/out of a job, which concerns the
critical functionality of the application: the verification
of an employee's identity and location.

As a guideline, the process should be as 'universal' as
possible; specifically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistent --- quick and reliable for its users
  \item Flexible --- simple configuration, minimal
        infrastructure
  \item Accessible --- no requirement(s) for specific
        human abilities
  \item Platform agnostic --- no restriction to specific
        hardware/software
  \item Independent --- no reliance on existing business
        applications
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aims}
To achieve the project's goal, the following aims must be
addressed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research existing applications concerned with
        clocking-in employees
  \item Investigate approaches in identifying people,
        locations, and assets
  \item Devise and design a theoretical identity and
        location verification methodology
  \item Design the system architecture, user interfaces,
        and technical implementation of the
        verification methodology
  \item Produce a set of functional and technical
        requirements for the system
  \item Setup the required tools for the development and
        testing phases, plus the project management tools
        for both
  \item Develop and test the application
  \item Evaluate the successes of the methodology in the
        completed application
  \item Discuss its real-world viability and potential
\end{itemize}
