\chapter*{Abstract}

The employer-employee relationship is changing.
More and more people are employed short-term, part-time,
and on zero-hours contracts, while people are starting to
reject traditional ideologies like employer loyalty and
in-office working.

As this trend continues, the need for employers to monitor
their staff becomes increasingly important.
This project aims to offload this responsibility from
managers to software.

Developing such an application faces a rare challenge in
user authentication: a motivation to share credentials.
Authentication is normally applied to protect people's
private information, so passwords are kept secret.
But if giving your details to another employee means
additional time on the job, and additional wages by
consequence, why not?
In such a scenario, how can a software system prevent this?
