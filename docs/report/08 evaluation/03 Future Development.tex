\section{Future Development}

Applying the application in a business context could be
approached in a few ways.
The most obvious use-case aligns with
\hyperref[s:existing]{existing applications}, in which a
company would deploy the system internally.
However, an company with an internal management structure
is unlikely to benefit from the \enquote{accountability}
model.

\projectname{} makes much more sense when offered as a
shared system to any business.
By offloading the management of employee time clocking to a
separate company, each business reduces its
responsibilities.
Furthermore, a centralised service would allow employees
from different companies to clock in/out of jobs, such as
gigs and festivals.

In any case, the system would need to support a more
complex structure to define jobs, starting with typical
business concepts like shifts, leave, and breaks.
It would also require a job management interface for formal
reviews of time clocks.
