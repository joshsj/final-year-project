# Participant Information Sheet

The University undertakes research as part of its function
for the community under its legal status. Data protection
allows us to use personal data for research with appropriate
safeguards in place under the legal basis of public tasks
that are in the public interest. A full statement of your
rights can be found at
https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-this-website/privacy-policy/privacy-notices/privacy-notice-for-research.
However, all University research is reviewed to ensure that
participants are treated appropriately and their rights
respected. This study was approved according to the
guidelines of the Teaching Programme Research Ethics
Committee of the College of Business, Technology and
Engineering, Sheffield Hallam University (SHU). Further

This research is being carried out to attain feedback about
the user experience of RendezVous: a service for new and
existing businesses to verify employee attendance at 'job
sites'.

You have been chosen for this study due to your personal
experience working on-location, e.g., as a bartender or
merchandise salesperson at an event, as a contracted
labourer, etc. Hopefully this should provide a basis to
conceptualise how you would use the application in your
role, hopefully returning more relevant feedback from users.

Your participation in this research is entirely your
decision; the information provided in this study is free to
keep, and you can decline to answer any questions if
desired. You may also withdraw from the research at any
point with no justification required.

This research will be carried out face-to-face with the
researcher/developer (Josh).You will have the freedom to
experiment with the application and provider your thoughts:
any/all feedback is useful. The researcher will also ask for
any ideas regarding new features in the application,
original or suggested. You will be asked to partake only
once, lasting around 20 minutes.

To protect your confidentiality, you will not be required to
provide any details which could uniquely identify yourself,
such as a date of birth. Alternative data will be collected
instead, e.g., an age range. The discussion will be recorded
and later transcribed, stored in a repository on Github
secured with a complex password and 2FA. Only the researcher
and project supervisor will be able to access the research.
Any/all research materials which is no longer in use will be
deleted permanently; this also applies to any materials left
at the end of the project.

The feedback gathered from these discussions will be
analysed for common ideas/suggestions, which will be
implemented into the application is deemed viable. For
example, if the general census considers the font size too
small, the next revision of the application will increase
it.
